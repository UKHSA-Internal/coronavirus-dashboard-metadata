The vaccination programme began on 8 December 2020 with people receiving the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. People began receiving the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine from 4 January 2021, and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April 2021. All 3 vaccines are given as 2 doses, at least 21 days apart, for a full vaccination course. 

Initially the vaccines were prioritised to be administered to the over-80s, care home residents and workers, and NHS staff. The number of people who received each dose is reported.

#### England

Vaccinations that were carried out in England are reported in the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS) which is the system of record for the vaccination programme in England. Only people aged 18 and over who have an NHS number and are currently alive are included.

Vaccinations to England residents that were given outside of England are included if they have been recorded in NIMS.

These are provided for population surveillance purposes, and will differ from NHS England daily outputs, which provide operational data for the management of the vaccination programme.

Vaccinations that were carried out in Scotland are reported to Public Health Scotland through the Vaccination Management Tool and General Practice IT systems. Only people aged 18 and over are included.
