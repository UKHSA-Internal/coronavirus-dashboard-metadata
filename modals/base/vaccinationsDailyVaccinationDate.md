Data are reported daily, and can be updated for historical dates as vaccinations given are recorded on the relevant system. Therefore, data for recent dates may be incomplete. 

The vaccination programme began on 8 December 2020 with people receiving the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. People began receiving the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine from 4 January 2021, and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April 2021. All 3 vaccines are given as 2 doses, at least 21 days apart, for a full vaccination course. 

The booster vaccination programme began on 16 September 2021. Booster doses are currently offered to people at highest risk from COVID-19 who received their second dose at least 6 months earlier, to give them longer-term protection. 

Third dose vaccinations are offered to people over 12 with severely weakened immune systems. Unlike boosters, third doses are considered part of a full vaccination course.

Initially the vaccines were prioritised to be administered to the over-80s, care home residents and workers, and NHS staff. The number of people who received each dose is reported.

#### England

Vaccinations that were carried out in England are reported in the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS) which is the system of record for the vaccination programme in England. Only people aged 12 and over who have an NHS number and are currently alive are included. Age is defined as a person's age at 31 March 2021.

Vaccinations to England residents that were given outside of England are included if they have been recorded in NIMS.

These are provided for population surveillance purposes, and will differ from NHS England daily outputs, which provide operational data for the management of the vaccination programme.

#### Scotland
 
Vaccinations that were carried out in Scotland are reported to Public Health Scotland through the Vaccination Management Tool and General Practice IT systems. Only people aged 12 and over are included. Age is defined as a person's age at 31 August 2021.

Vaccinations to Scottish residents that were given outside of Scotland are included if they have been recorded in the Vaccination Management Tool.
