#### Rate calculations

Rates are calculated in order to compare areas or population groups of different sizes.
All rates currently presented on this website are crude rates expressed per 100,000 population, 
ie the count (eg cases or deaths) is divided by the denominator population and then multiplied 
by 100,000, without any adjustment for other factors.  

Populations used are Office for National Statistics 2020 mid-year estimates, except for Middle Super Output Areas and NHS Regions,
for which 2020 estimates are not yet available, so 2019 mid-year estimates are used.
