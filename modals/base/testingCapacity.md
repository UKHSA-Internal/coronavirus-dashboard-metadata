Lab-based coronavirus tests are processed in many laboratories around the UK. Projected laboratory capacity is an estimate of the number of tests each lab can process each day based on the availability of staff, chemical reagents and other resources required. These estimates are made locally by the labs themselves, aggregated and published weekly by the Department for Heath and Social Care.

Testing capacity data are available by test type:  
* Lab-based virus tests that test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.  This includes lab-based pillar 1 and 2 tests and virus tests undertaken in pillar 4.
* Antibody serology tests that test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies.  This includes pillar 3 tests antibody serology tests undertaken in pillar 4. 

Testing capacity data are available for the UK only so data cannot be presented separately for the four nations. 

From week commencing 15 March 2021, daily testing capacity changed to be reported retrospectively once a week on a Friday. This is because Northern Ireland Health and Social Care trusts discontinued daily reporting of the Pillar 1 capacity figure, reporting their figures once a week instead.

For pillars 1, 2 and 3 operational issues at labs can result in labs performing below capacity. There is also volatility in demand across the week, with significantly higher test volumes during the week, and lower test volumes during the weekend.  Although samples are moved between labs to maximise throughput where there is a mismatch, this is limited by the life of the sample and distances between labs. It can also be difficult to move capacity between labs due to operational differences (such as equipment or digital systems).

For pillar 4, lab capacity is procured based on the number of participants enrolled in a particular study, and therefore any spare capacity cannot be used by other pillars.

Although number of tests processed on a given day or week can be compared to the available lab capacity to better understand how the programme is operating, this comparison requires caution due to the different approaches adopted to forecast capacity in each pillar.
