Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are lab-based and test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This data shows the number of people who received a PCR test in the previous 7 days, and the percentage of people who received a PCR test in the previous 7 days who had at least one positive PCR test result.

If a person has had more than one test result in the 7-day period, they are only counted once. If any of their tests in that period were positive, they count as one person with a positive test result. The positivity percentage is the number of people with a positive test result, divided by the number of people tested and multiplied by 100.
