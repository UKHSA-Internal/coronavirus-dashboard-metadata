#### Rolling averages

This website primarily presents daily data.  Counts of cases, admissions, deaths, etc vary
from day to day just through natural random changes, but also tend to vary throughout the week
systematically, so that rates are consistently lower at weekends for example.

In order to help to identify trends or patterns in the data over time, 7 day rolling averages can
be calculated.  These are updated daily, but even out the random variation and the weekly
seasonality.

Each day's observation is combined with the previous three days and the following three days, and
the mean of all seven days' figures is presented.

For indicators where the most recent days' data are incomplete, the final few points in the rolling
average series will not be displayed, as the averages will increase when data are complete.
