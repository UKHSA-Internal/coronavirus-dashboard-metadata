Provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in the UK where COVID-19 is mentioned as a cause on the death certificate.  The deceased may not have had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19.  People who had had COVID-19 but did not have it mentioned on their death certificate as a cause of death are excluded.

Data are published weekly by the national statistics bodies in the four nations: deaths registered up to any Friday are published 11 days later on the Tuesday.

Deaths based on death certificates are currently presented by registration date (the date the death was registered). Deaths are allocated to the deceased's usual area of residence.

Bank Holidays can affect the number of registrations made within a given week.

Details of collection and further data are available on the national statistics bodies' websites, listed below.
