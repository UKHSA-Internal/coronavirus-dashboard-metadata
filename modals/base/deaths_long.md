The data do not include deaths of people who had COVID-19 but had not been tested or people who had been tested negative and subsequently caught the virus and died.

Deaths of people who have tested positively for COVID-19 could in some cases be due to a different cause.

#### England

Data on COVID-19 deaths in England are produced by UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). These data are taken from 3 different sources:

* NHS England: deaths are reported by NHS Trusts using the [COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/04/C0389-update-to-cpns-reporting-letter-27-april-2020.pdf) (this includes only deaths in hospitals)

* UKHSA Health Protection Teams: the local teams report deaths notified to them (mainly deaths not in hospitals)

* Linking data on confirmed positive cases (identified through testing by NHS and UKHSA laboratories and commercial partners) to the NHS Demographic Batch Service: when a patient dies, the NHS central register of patients is notified (this is not limited to deaths in hospitals). The list of all lab-confirmed cases is checked against the NHS central register each day, to check if any of the patients have died.

Data on deaths from these 3 sources are linked to the list of people who have had a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by a UKHSA or NHS laboratory (pillar 1 of the government's mass testing strategy) or through testing in commercial labs (pillar 2). This is to identify as many people with a confirmed diagnosis who have died as possible.

Deaths will often appear in 2 or 3 different sources, so the records are checked and merged into one database and duplicates are removed so there is no double counting. Automated processes are used to ensure that the data are as complete as possible. Full details of the process of producing the data are available on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary).

The final list of deaths includes all deaths previously reported by [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/), but also includes other deaths of patients who were confirmed cases, whether they died in hospital or elsewhere.

Deaths reported for England each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the day before the reporting date stated above.

#### Northern Ireland

Data for Northern Ireland include all cases reported to the Public Health Agency (PHA) where the deceased had a positive test for COVID-19 and died within 28 days, whether or not COVID-19 was the cause of death.  PHA sources include reports by healthcare workers (eg Health and Social Care Trusts, GPs) and information from local laboratory reports. Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the day before the reporting date stated above.  The deaths are reported a day earlier by the Northern Ireland Department of Health.

#### Scotland

Data for Scotland include deaths which have been registered with National Records of Scotland (NRS) where a laboratory confirmed report of COVID-19 in the 28 days prior to death exists. 

The daily total is an update of the data described above/previously, using the latest daily information received from NRS to check where a laboratory positive report for COVID-19 exists. These data include all deaths in individuals with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in Scotland and therefore include deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community.
 
This daily number of new deaths registered will not necessarily equal the number of deaths on a particular day, owing to the time allowed for families to register deaths. Numbers of registrations are also lower at weekends.

Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the day before the reporting date stated above.  The deaths are reported a day earlier by the Scottish Government.

#### Wales

Data for Wales include reports to Public Health Wales of deaths of hospitalised patients in Welsh Hospitals or care home residents where COVID-19 has been confirmed with a positive laboratory test and the clinician suspects this was a causative factor in the death. 

The figures do not include individuals who may have died from COVID-19 but who were not confirmed by laboratory testing, those who died in other settings, or Welsh residents who died outside of Wales.

Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the day before the reporting date stated above.
