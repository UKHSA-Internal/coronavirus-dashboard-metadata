As of 21 August 2020, daily testing figures stopped being reported at weekends. Data for the three previous days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) are updated on a Monday.

**More general information on testing**

There are three types of test being carried out:  
* Lab-based virus tests that test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.  These include lab-based pillar 1 and 2 tests and virus tests undertaken in pillar 4.
* Antibody serology tests that test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies.  These include pillar 3 tests and antibody serology tests undertaken in pillar 4.  All pillar 4 antibody testing is reported as England by DHSC.
* Rapid lateral flow virus tests that test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.  These are swab tests that give results in less than an hour, without needing to go to a laboratory. Rapid lateral flow test data are currently available for England only.

The number of tests conducted counts all tests that have remained within the control of the programme and those that have been sent out and subsequently returned to be processed in a lab. These include tests which are negative and positive and may also include tests which were inconclusive (void). Reasons for void tests include: 

* The testing within the laboratory was unable to give an exact answer as the test gave an equivocal result (it wasn’t clearly negative or positive). 
* There was an issue with the sample when it is delivered to the laboratory making it impossible to return a result, such as the tube was damaged or leaked, the test could not be scanned, the instructions were not followed or the swab was not put in the tube. Due to the issue with the sample, some of these tests may not have been processed by the lab at all.

Tests are counted at the time at which they were processed.
#### UK

UK data are available for virus testing and antibody serology testing. UK Data are not available for weekends between 4 July and 10 August 2020 because Northern Ireland did not report at weekends during this period.  

#### England and Wales

Data are only available from 1 April 2020. Up to 13 July 2020, only pillar 1 lab-based tests were included. Pillar 2 lab-based tests are available from 14 July 2020.

The number of tests conducted by test result in England is published as part of the weekly [NHS Test and Trace Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports).

For England, rapid lateral flow tests are available from 21 October 2020. This data contains rapid lateral flow tests reported through the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and doesn't include tests conducted where the tests were not registered digitally. In future, all rapid lateral flow tests will be reported via the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and will be included.

Due to the change in guidance issued on 23 December 2020 to increase testing in care home staff, the requirement for care home staff to register negative rapid lateral flow test results was suspended between 31 December 2020 and 15 January 2021 inclusive. As a result, a proportion of rapid lateral flow tests conducted on care home staff will not be included for these dates.

#### Northern Ireland

Data are only available from 22 April 2020. Up to 2 July 2020, only pillar 1 tests were included. Pillar 2 tests are available from 3 July 2020.  Northern Ireland did not report at weekends between 4 July and 10 August 2020, so daily figures for Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays are missing and cumulative figures shown on Saturdays and Sundays are figures for the previous Friday.

#### Scotland

Data are only available from 1 April 2020. Pillar 1 tests were included throughout the time series, but pillar 2 tests have been added at various times.

Until 7 July 2020, the total number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day by Regional Testing Centres (RTC) as part of pillar 2 of the UK Government's testing programme were reported through the Department of Health and Social Care based on data from the contractors who operate the centres. This included tests done at the drive through centres and mobile units, but not tests processed from home testing kits.

From 8 July 2020 onwards, the total number of COVID-19 tests with results in the Health Protection Scotland ECOSS system reported from the UK Government testing programme are reported, including those processed from home testing kits and the social care portal, as well as drive throughs and mobile units. These now reflect all test results reported on across pillars 1 and 2.  Void tests are not included.
