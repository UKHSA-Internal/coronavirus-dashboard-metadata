Provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in the UK where COVID-19 is mentioned as a cause on the death certificate.  The deceased may not have had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19.  People who had had COVID-19 but did not have it mentioned on their death certificate as a cause of death are excluded.

Data are published weekly by the national statistics bodies in the four nations: deaths registered up to any Friday are published 11 days later on the Tuesday.

Deaths based on death certificates are presented by date of death. Coding of deaths by cause for the latest week is incomplete.  These figures represent death occurrences, there can be a delay between the date a death occurred and the date a death was registered. Deaths are allocated to the deceased's usual area of residence.

Bank Holidays can affect the number of registrations made within a given week.

Details of collection and further data are available on the national statistics bodies' websites, listed below.

#### United Kingdom

England, Wales and Northern Ireland weekly deaths run from Saturday to Friday, Scotland deaths run from Monday to Sunday. For this reason, the sum of individual days will not aggregate to the week total. 

#### England and Wales

The number of deaths by date of occurrence are based on deaths registered up to a later registration date to take into account registration delay. More information on registration delays can be found on the [Office for National Statistics website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/impactofregistrationdelaysonmortalitystatisticsinenglandandwales/2019)

Because of changes to local authority boundaries in 2020 and 2021, data are no longer published by ONS and therefore unavailable on the dashboard for former districts within Buckinghamshire (Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks and Wycombe) and Northamptonshire (Corby, Daventry, East Northamptonshire, Kettering, Northampton, South Northamptonshire and Wellingborough).
