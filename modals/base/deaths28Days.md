People who died more than 28 days after their first positive test are not included, whether or not COVID-19 was the cause of death.  

Death data can be presented by when death occurred (date of death) or when the death was reported (date reported) and the availability of each of these time series varies by area:

* Deaths by date of death - each death is assigned to the date that the person died irrespective of how long it took for the death to be reported.  Previously reported data are therefore continually updated
* Deaths by date reported - each death is assigned to the date when it was first included in the published totals.  The specific 24 hour periods reported against each date vary by nation and are defined below

Deaths can be removed or reallocated as records are regularly updated with new information, which can create apparent discrepancies. 
If numbers for an area are low, these changes can result in negative numbers, which are shown as 0.
However, the changes would be included for areas where a negative number would not be created. 

For example:
Local authority A reports 2 new deaths. Local authority B reports no new deaths, but 1 previously reported death is reallocated to another local authority. This shows as 0 new deaths reported for local authority B.

These local authorities form a larger area. 1 death is shown in this larger area (2 deaths in local authority A, minus 1 death in local authority B).

Deaths are allocated to the deceased's usual area of residence.

#### England

Data on COVID-19 associated deaths in England are produced by Public Health England (PHE) from multiple sources linked to confirmed case data.  Deaths newly reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the previous day.

Deaths are only included if the deceased had had a positive test for COVID-19 and died within 28 days of the first positive test.

Regional, UTLA and LTLA death counts exclude England deaths for which the exact location of residence is unknown and therefore may not sum to the England total.

Where available, postcode of residence for deaths is obtained from the information collected at the time of testing. Where this is unavailable, postcode of residence is supplemented if available from ONS mortality records, Health Protection Team reports, and NHS Digital Patient Demographic Service records.

Due to a processing update, 141 historical deaths within 28 days in England were excluded from the published data on 21 November 2020. This issue was corrected for data published on 22 November 2020, which included deaths omitted on 21 November 2020 within the total and daily number of newly reported deaths for 22 November 2020.

Due to their small populations, counts for City of London and Isles of Scilly are combined with Hackney and Cornwall respectively when presented at local authority level, in order to prevent disclosure control issues. 

Full details of the methodology are available on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary).

#### Northern Ireland

Data for Northern Ireland include all cases reported to the Public Health Agency (PHA) where the deceased had a positive test for COVID-19 and died within 28 days.  PHA sources include reports by healthcare workers (eg Health and Social Care Trusts, GPs) and information from local laboratory reports. Deaths reported against each date cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the same day. 

Deaths in Northern Ireland were not reported on 25 and 27 December 2020, and 1 January 2021.

#### Scotland

Data for Scotland include deaths in all settings which have been registered with National Records of Scotland (NRS) where a laboratory confirmed report of COVID-19 in the 28 days prior to death exists. Deaths reported against each date cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the same day. 

#### Wales

Data for Wales include reports to Public Health Wales of deaths of hospitalised patients in Welsh Hospitals or care home residents where COVID-19 has been confirmed with a positive laboratory test and the clinician suspects this was a causative factor in the death.  The figures do not include individuals who may have died from COVID-19 but who were not confirmed by laboratory testing, those who died in other settings, or Welsh residents who died outside of Wales.  Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the previous day.  The majority of deaths included occur within 28 days of a positive test result.

On 13 December 2020, Wales did not report any data. Deaths in Wales were not reported on 25 December 2020 and 1 January 2021.
