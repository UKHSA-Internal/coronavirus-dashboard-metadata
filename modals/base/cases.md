COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and testing them for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the test is positive (except for rapid lateral flow tests which have negative confirmatory lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests taken within 72 hours), this is referred to as a case.  If a person has more than one positive test, they are only counted as one case.  

Cases data includes all positive lab confirmed virus test results plus, in England, positive rapid lateral flow tests that do not have negative confirmatory lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests taken within 72 hours.

Data can be presented by specimen date (the date when the sample was taken from the person being tested) or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.  

Cases can be removed and reallocated, which can create apparent discrepancies. 
If numbers for an area are low, these changes can result in negative numbers, which are shown as 0.
However, the change would be included for areas where a negative number would not be created. 

For example:
Local authority 1 reports 2 cases.
Local authority 2 reports no new cases, but 1 case is reallocated. This shows as 0 cases.
These local authorities form a larger area. 1 case is shown in this area (2 cases in local authority 1, minus 1 case in local authority 2).

Cases are allocated to the person's area of residence. From 16 November 2020, PHE has updated the way it records the location of people who test positive or negative for COVID-19 in England. It now prioritises addresses given at the point of testing over the details registered on a patientâ€™s record in the NHS Digital Patient Demographic Service. This better reflects the distribution of cases and testing. However, it may give rise to differences in previously reported numbers of cases and rates in some areas. The change has been retrospectively applied to tests carried out from 1 September 2020, and data in the dashboard was updated to reflect this change on 16 November 2020. Due to reallocation of cases in this way, the number of cases reported by local authority may be artificially high or low on 16 November 2020.

PHE has published [a comparison of geographic allocation methodologies](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-comparison-of-geographic-allocation-of-cases-in-england-by-lower-tier-local-authority) for cases by specimen date at lower tier local authority level.

#### UK

UK data include results from both pillar 1 and pillar 2 testing.  Up to 1 July 2020, these data were collected separately meaning that people who had tested positive via both methods were counted twice.  In combining the data for pillars 1 and 2 on 2 July 2020 around 30,000 duplicates were found and removed from the data. This is why the number of cases reported reduced from 1 July 2020 to 2 July 2020.  The technical issue affecting England reported cases on 3 and 4 October 2020 (see below) also affects the UK cases by date reported. 

For the four nations, initially only cases identified through pillar 1 testing were included but cases identified through pillar 2 testing (see below) have been included, from different dates, for all nations.

#### England

A positive case is defined as as an individual with at least one confirmed positive test from a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid lateral flow tests or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. Positive rapid lateral flow test results can be confirmed with PCR tests taken within 72 hours. If the PCR test results are negative, these are not reported as cases.

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 2 July 2020, from when pillar 2 cases are also included. 

A technical issue identified on 2 October 2020 resulted in a delay in reporting of 15,841 cases between 25 September 2020 and 2 October 2020.  These cases were instead reported on 3 and 4 October 2020 creating an artificial spike in the number of cases reported on these dates.  Cases by specimen date data are not affected.

On 27 November 2020, 1,283 historic cases were removed from the dashboard. These were void tests originally reported in error by the laboratory as positive. This affected specimen dates between 11 and 23 November 2020 in around 100 local authorities. The cumulative total number of people tested positive was revised down on 27 November 2020. Historical published date totals have not been changed.

Due to their small populations, counts for City of London and Isles of Scilly are combined with Hackney and Cornwall respectively when presented at local authority level, in order to prevent disclosure control issues. 

##### Change in cases on 9 April 2021
On 9 April 2021, the way cases are reported was changed. Cases that have been identified through a positive rapid lateral flow 
test will be removed for people who took Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests within 3 days that were all negative. Cases of this type that were 
previously reported were removed from the cumulative total, reducing the total by 8,010. Newly reported numbers of cases for the UK and England on 9 April 2021
were unaffected by the removal of these. Historical published date totals have not been changed.

Newly reported cases at regional and local authority level within England are calculated as the daily change in the total number of cases. 
This means that for 9 April 2021, these show significantly lower numbers or zero, and should not be considered as the actual number of new cases reported on that date. 
Details of the changes and numbers of newly reported cases for 9 April 2021 are available in 
[csv (wide format)](/downloads/miscellaneous/cases_reported_2021-04-09_unstacked.csv) and 
[csv (long format)](/downloads/miscellaneous/cases_reported_2021-04-09_stacked.csv).

#### Northern Ireland

A positive case is defined as an individual who has received a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result. If an individual tests positive via an rapid lateral flow test they are required to take a confirmatory PCR test in all situations. Positive rapid lateral flow tests are therefore not included in the figures for positive cases for Northern Ireland.

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 26 June 2020, from when pillar 2 cases are also included. 

Cases in Northern Ireland were not reported on 25 and 27 December 2020, and 1 January 2021.

#### Scotland

A positive case is defined as an individual with at least one confirmed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive test. The number of rapid lateral flow test positive results are not included in daily case counts. 

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 15 June 2020, from when pillar 2 cases are also included. Scotland's data include a batch of cases for which specimen date was not available over a 10 day period between 15 and 25 April 2020. These samples were assigned a specimen date in the midpoint within this range (20 April 2020) causing the artificial spike in the chart.

#### Wales

A positive case is defined as an individual who has received a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result. If an individual tests positive via an rapid lateral flow test they are advised to take a confirmatory PCR test, therefore positive rapid lateral flow tests are not included in the figures for positive cases for Wales. 

Data include mainly pillar 1 cases until 14 July 2020, from when pillar 2 cases have been included. This included 842 historic pillar 2 cases that had not previously been reported in the UK total, causing an increase in the UK total.

As a result of the planned maintenance of the NHS Wales Laboratory Information Management System that occurred between 11th and 12th December 2020, there was significant under reporting of lighthouse laboratory testing. On 13 December 2020, Wales did not report any data. The new cases reported on 17th December 2020 included a backlog of around 11,000 samples processed in the lighthouse laboratories mainly collected between the 9th and 15th December 2020.

Cases in Wales were not reported on 25 December 2020 and 1 January 2021.
