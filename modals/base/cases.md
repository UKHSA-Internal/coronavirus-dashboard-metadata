COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and testing them for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a case.  If a person has had more than one positive test they are only counted as one case.  

Cases data includes all positive virus test results, even if they are not confirmed by a lab.  For example, positive test results from swab tests performed using a lateral flow device, which do not need to go to a lab, contribute towards the cases total.

Data can be presented by specimen date (the date when the sample was taken from the person being tested) or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.  

Cases are allocated to the person's area of residence. From 16 November 2020, PHE has updated the way it records the location of people who test positive or negative for COVID-19 in England. It now prioritises addresses given at the point of testing over the details registered on a patientâ€™s record in the NHS Digital Patient Demographic Service. This better reflects the distribution of cases and testing. However, it may give rise to differences in previously reported numbers of cases and rates in some areas. The change has been retrospectively applied to tests carried out from 1 September 2020, and data in the dashboard was updated to reflect this change on 16 November 2020. Due to reallocation of cases in this way, the number of cases reported by local authority may be artificially high or low on 16 November 2020.

PHE has published [a comparison of geographic allocation methodologies](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-comparison-of-geographic-allocation-of-cases-in-england-by-lower-tier-local-authority) for cases by specimen date at lower tier local authority level.

#### UK

UK data include results from both pillar 1 and pillar 2 testing.  Up to 1 July, these data were collected separately meaning that people who had tested positive via both methods were counted twice.  In combining the data for pillars 1 and 2 on 2 July around 30,000 duplicates were found and removed from the data. This is why the number of cases reported reduced from 1 July to 2 July.  The technical issue affecting England reported cases on 3 and 4 October 2020 (see below) also affects the UK cases by date reported. 

For the four nations, initially only cases identified through pillar 1 testing were included but cases identified through pillar 2 testing (see below) have been included, from different dates, for all nations.

#### England

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 2 July, from when pillar 2 cases are also included. 

A technical issue identified on 2 October 2020 resulted in a delay in reporting of 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October.  These cases were instead reported on 3 and 4 October creating an artificial spike in the number of cases reported on these dates.  Cases by specimen date data are not affected.

On 27 November 2020, 1,283 historic cases were removed from the dashboard. These were void tests originally reported in error by the laboratory as positive. This affected specimen dates between 11 and 23 November in around 100 local authorities. The cumulative total number of people tested positive was revised down on 27 November 2020. Historic published date totals have not been changed.

Due to their small populations, counts for City of London and Isles of Scilly are combined with Hackney and Cornwall respectively when presented at local authority level, in order to prevent disclosure control issues. 

#### Northern Ireland

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 26 June, from when pillar 2 cases are also included. 

Cases in Northern Ireland were not reported on 25 and 27 December 2020.

#### Scotland

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 15 June, from when pillar 2 cases are also included. Scotland's data include a batch of cases for which specimen date was not available over a 10 day period between 15 and 25 April. These samples were assigned a specimen date in the midpoint within this range (20 April) causing the artificial spike in the chart.

#### Wales

Data include mainly pillar 1 cases until 14 July, from when pillar 2 cases have been included. This included 842 historic pillar 2 cases that had not previously been reported in the UK total, causing an increase in the UK total.

As a result of the planned maintenance of the NHS Wales Laboratory Information Management System that occurred between 11th and 12th December, there was significant under reporting of lighthouse laboratory testing. On 13 December 2020, Wales did not report any data. The new cases reported on 17th December included a backlog of around 11,000 samples processed in the lighthouse laboratories mainly collected between the 9th and 15th December.

Cases in Wales were not reported on 25 December 2020.
