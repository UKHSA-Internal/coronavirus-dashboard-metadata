The UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations' data are available.  Data are not reported by each nation every day.  Caution is needed when interpreting the data as the definitions are not always consistent between the four nations.

#### England

England figures are the numbers of patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation and includes Nightingale hospitals. Data are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement.

#### Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland include suspected COVID-19 patients in their COVID-19 patient count for dates prior to 13 April 2020. Their figures are the numbers of patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation.

#### Scotland

Scotland include suspected COVID-19 patients in their COVID-19 patient count. Their figures include people in intensive care units and may include a small number of patients who are not on mechanical ventilation. On 11 September 2020 the data were updated to exclude people (in larger NHS Boards) who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 but remain in intensive care units for another reason.
