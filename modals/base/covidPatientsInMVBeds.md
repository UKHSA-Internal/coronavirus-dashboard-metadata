The UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations' data are available.  Data are not reported by each nation every day.  Caution is needed when interpreting the data as the definitions are not always consistent between the four nations.

#### England

England figures are the numbers of patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation and includes Nightingale hospitals. Data are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement. The data collected is classified as management information. It has been collected on a
daily basis with a tight turn round time. No revisions have been made to the dataset, where known errors have come to light trusts have made the appropriate correction in the following dayâ€™s data. Any analysis of the data should be undertaken with this in mind. 

Daily data at NHS Trust level is reported weekly on Thursdays, in line with NHS England reporting.

Northern Ireland include suspected COVID-19 patients in their COVID-19 patient count for dates prior to 13 April 2020. Their figures are the numbers of patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation.

#### Scotland

Their figures include people in intensive care units and may include a small number of patients who are not on mechanical ventilation.
