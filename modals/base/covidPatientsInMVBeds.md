The UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations' data are available.  Data are not reported by each nation every day.  Caution is needed when interpreting the data as the definitions are not always consistent between the four nations.

#### England

England figures are the numbers of patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation and includes Nightingale hospitals. Data are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement. The data collected is classified as management information. It has been collected on a
daily basis with a tight turn round time. No revisions have been made to the dataset, where known errors have come to light trusts have made the appropriate correction in the following day’s data. Any analysis of the data should be undertaken with this in mind. 

Daily data at NHS Trust level is reported weekly on Thursdays, in line with NHS England reporting.

#### Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland include suspected COVID-19 patients in their COVID-19 patient count for dates prior to 13 April 2020. Their figures are the numbers of patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation.

#### Scotland

Scotland include suspected COVID-19 patients in their COVID-19 patient count. Their figures include people in intensive care units and may include a small number of patients who are not on mechanical ventilation. On 11 September 2020 the data were updated to exclude people (in larger NHS Boards) who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 but remain in intensive care units for another reason.

#### Wales

Wales include suspected COVID-19 patients in their COVID-19 patient count. Their figures include invasive ventilated beds in a critical care setting, plus those outside of a critical care environment and also include surge capacity.

From 19 October 2020, specialist critical care beds have been included in these figures. From 13 November 2020, only critical care beds that could be staffed are included as available. 

From 18 January 2021, no patients occupying an invasive ventilated bed (critical care bed) should be counted as “recovering” COVID-19 patients as they are still requiring a high level of care. Any patient previously reported as “recovering” will now be counted under “confirmed”. This will result in an increase in the number of invasive ventilated beds occupied by “confirmed” COVID-19 patients (an increase of around 14 patients at the point of implementation) and no invasive ventilated beds showing as occupied by “recovering” patients. This change will have no impact on the total number of COVID-19 related patients.
