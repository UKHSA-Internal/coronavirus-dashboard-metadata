Data are reported daily, and include all vaccination events that are entered on the relevant system at the time of extract.

#### UK and nations

Uptake percentages for the UK and nations are presented by report date. Percentage uptake by report date is calculated by dividing the total number of vaccinations given to people of all ages, by the mid-year 2019 population estimate for people aged 18 and over, published by the Office for National Statistics.

The percentage uptake published here for the nations of the UK may differ from those reported by the nations individually. In particular, figures published by Public Health Wales use denominators of those registered with NHS Wales rather than mid-year population estimates.

#### Local areas in England

Uptake percentages for regions and local authorities are presented by vaccination date. Percentage uptake by vaccination date is calculated by dividing the total number of vaccinations given to people aged 18 and over by the number of people aged 18 and over on the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS).
Vaccinations that were carried out in England are reported in NIMS which is the system of record for the vaccination programme in England. Only people who have an NHS number and are currently alive are included.

#### Local areas in Scotland

Uptake percentages for local authorities are presented by vaccination date. Percentage uptake by vaccination date is calculated by dividing the total number of vaccinations given to people aged 18 and over by the mid-year 2019 population estimate for people aged 18 and over.
