Data are reported daily, and include all vaccination events that are entered on the relevant system at the time of extract.

#### UK and nations headline uptake

Headline uptake percentages for the UK and nations are presented by report date. Percentage uptake by report date is calculated by dividing the total number of vaccinations given to people of all ages, by the mid-year 2020 population estimate for people aged 18 and over, published by the Office for National Statistics.

The percentage uptake published here for the nations of the UK may differ from those reported by the nations individually. In particular, figures published by Public Health Wales use denominators of those registered with NHS Wales rather than mid-year population estimates.

Percentage uptake for age groups in England is calculated on a different basis, and presented for the purposes of population surveillance and comparison with regional and local authority data (see below).

#### Local areas and age breakdowns in England

Uptake percentages for regions and local authorities, along with age breakdowns for England and local areas within England, are presented by vaccination date. Percentage uptake by vaccination date is calculated by dividing the total number of vaccinations given to people aged 18 and over by the number of people aged 18 and over on the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS).

Vaccinations that were carried out in England are reported in NIMS which is the system of record for the vaccination programme in England. Only people who have an NHS number and are currently alive are included. 

These are provided for population surveillance purposes, and will differ from NHS England daily outputs, which provide operational data for the management of the vaccination programme.

#### Local areas in Scotland

Uptake percentages for local authorities are presented by vaccination date. Percentage uptake by vaccination date is calculated by dividing the total number of vaccinations given to people aged 18 and over by the mid-year 2020 population estimate for people aged 18 and over.
