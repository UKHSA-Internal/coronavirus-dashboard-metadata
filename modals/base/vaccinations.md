Data are reported weekly. The vaccination programme began on 8 December 2020 with people receiving the vaccine developed
by Pfizer/BioNTech, which requires 2 doses, at least 21 days apart, for a full vaccination course. Initially the vaccines were prioritised to be administered to the over-80s, care home residents and workers, and NHS staff. The number of people who received each dose is reported.

#### UK

Data was provided by NHS England for the combined period 8-20 December 2020, which is included in the UK values for the week ending 20 December 2020. For this reason, no UK values are presented for week ending 13 December 2020. See the England section below for further details.

#### England

Vaccinations that were carried out in England are reported in the National Immunisation Management Service which is the system of record for the vaccination programme in England, including both hospital hubs and local vaccination services. Data are extracted each Tuesday to reflect activity up to the close of the preceding Sunday. 

At the start of the programme, NHS England could only provide data for the combined period 8-20 December. The implications are:
-	No England, or UK figures are possible for week ending 13 December
-	The England figure presented as week ending 20 December, includes the wider time period of 8-20 December
-	The UK values presented as week ending 20 December, also include vaccinations in England from 10-13 December
-	The cumulative totals by date are not affected
