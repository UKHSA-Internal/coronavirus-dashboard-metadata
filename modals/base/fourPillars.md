**Testing Pillars**

The government's mass testing programme includes four types of tests known as pillars:

**Pillar 1: NHS and PHE Testing**


Virus testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers. Pillar 1 data for England is provided by the NHS and PHE, and data from the devolved administrations are provided by the Department of Health of Northern Ireland, the Scottish Government, and Public Health Wales. Public Health Wales provide combined pillar 1 and partial pillar 2 data where tests are processed in NHS Wales labs.

**Pillar 2: UK Government testing programme** 


Virus testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance.

Pillar 2 uses Lighthouse laboratories and has partnership arrangements with public, private and academic sector laboratories. Pillar 2 data for the UK (excluding Wales tests processed in NHS labs in Wales) is collected by commercial partners.
 
* Lighthouse laboratories 

Capacity is the maximum number of samples the Lighthouse laboratories estimate they will be able to process the following day. The figure takes into account equipment, laboratory facilities, anticipated machine down time, and staffing. Since 27 October 2020 we have been able to report a more accurate figure which is estimated daily by each laboratory and takes into account known operational issues within the laboratory at the time of reporting (e.g. stock shortages, staff sickness), as opposed to weekly.
 
* Partner laboratories 

Capacity for partner laboratories is the daily number of tests that the laboratory has been contracted to complete.

* Rapid lateral flow testing

Rapid lateral flow tests test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and are swab tests that give results in less than an hour, without needing to go to a laboratory. 

**Pillar 3: Antibody testing** 


Antibody serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19, reported from 1 June 2020 onwards. Pillar 3 data is provided for England by NHS England and Improvement (NHSEI).


**Pillar 4: Surveillance testing** 

Data from 12 July 2021 includes antibody serology testing data from the SIREN (Sarscov2 Immunity & REinfection EvaluatioN) study. SIREN is investigating whether healthcare workers who have previously been infected with COVID-19 and/or have been vaccinated are protected from the virus. 

Virus testing and antibody serology testing for national surveillance supported by PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities and other partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, for example on the accuracy and ease of use of home testing. Pillar 4 data is collected by the NHS, PHE, and individual research study leads for the UK.

For pillar 4, laboratory capacity is procured based on the number of participants enrolled in a particular study and therefore any spare capacity cannot be used by other pillars.

Previously pillar 4 laboratory capacity was the total amount of capacity procured based on the number of participants enrolled in a particular surveillance study, averaged across a testing period. Because Pillar 4 studies are dependent on participants sending back test kits or having blood samples taken, it is hard to accurately forecast daily expected demand. Pillar 4 have a flexible agreement with the laboratories to account for variability in returns across the testing period and are not restricted by a daily limit. Since 21 September 2020 therefore, the reported pillar 4 capacity on a given date is the same as the number of tests actually processed by pillar 4 on that same day.
