**Testing Pillars**

The government's mass testing programme includes four types of tests known as pillars:

**Pillar 1: NHS and PHE Testing**


Virus testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers


**Pillar 2: UK Government testing programme** 


Virus testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance.

Pillar 2 uses Lighthouse laboratories and has partnership arrangements with public, private and academic sector laboratories
 
* Lighthouse laboratories 

Capacity is the maximum number of samples the Lighthouse laboratories estimate they will be able to process the following day. The figure takes into account equipment, laboratory facilities, anticipated machine down time, and staffing. Since the 27th of October we have been able to report a more accurate figure which is estimated daily by each laboratory and takes into account known operational issues within the laboratory at the time of reporting (e.g. stock shortages, staff sickness), as opposed to weekly.
 
* Partner laboratories 

Capacity for partner laboratories is the daily number of tests that the laboratory has been contracted to complete.

* Lateral flow device testing

Lateral flow device tests test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and are swab tests that give results in less than an hour, without needing to go to a laboratory. 

**Pillar 3: Antibody testing** 


Antibody serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19, reported from 1st June onwards


**Pillar 4: Surveillance testing** 


Virus testing and antibody serology testing for national surveillance supported by PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities and other partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, for example on the accuracy and ease of use of home testing.

For pillar 4, laboratory capacity is procured based on the number of participants enrolled in a particular study and therefore any spare capacity cannot be used by other pillars.

Previously pillar 4 laboratory capacity was the total amount of capacity procured based on the number of participants enrolled in a particular surveillance study, averaged across a testing period. Because Pillar 4 studies are dependent on participants sending back test kits, it is hard to accurately forecast daily expected demand. Pillar 4 have a flexible agreement with the laboratories to account for variability in returns across the testing period and are not restricted by a daily limit. Since 21st September therefore, the reported pillar 4 capacity on a given date is the same as the number of tests actually processed by pillar 4 on that same day.
