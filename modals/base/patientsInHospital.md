Each hospital trust reports daily on the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital at 8am. The UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations' data are available.  Data are not reported by each nation every day.  Caution is needed when interpreting the data as the definitions are not always consistent between the four nations.

#### England

Data include all hospitals and are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement. The data collected is classified as management information. It has been collected on a daily basis with a tight turn round time. No revisions have been made to the dataset, where known errors have come to light trusts have made the appropriate correction in the following day’s data. Any analysis of the data should be undertaken with this in mind. 

On 11 December 2020 the coverage of data for patients in hospital was updated to align with NHS England publications and as a result the full time series for this item was revised.  Previously the coverage had only been for Acute trusts with a type 1 A&E, this has now been extended so the time series now covers all Acute trusts, Mental Health Trusts and the Independent Sector.  This brings this metric in line with other metrics – admissions to hospital and patients in mechanical ventilation beds which have always been on this basis. 

Daily data at NHS Trust level is reported weekly on Thursdays, in line with NHS England reporting.

#### Northern Ireland

Data published before 12 August 2020 included suspected cases as well as confirmed cases.  The full series was revised on 12 August.

#### Scotland

On 11 September 2020 the data were updated to exclude people (in larger NHS Boards) who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 but remain in hospital for another reason.  Further details about the data are available in the Trends in daily COVID-19 data spreadsheets available on the [Scottish Government website](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-trends-in-daily-data/)

##### Wales

It was announced on 13 March 2020 that all non-urgent activity should stop to prepare for the pandemic. Following the re-introduction of elective procedures from June 2020, patients in hospital who were suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of admission for elective procedures were included, even if they received a negative test later. This inflated the numbers of suspected cases in hospital at the time of reporting.

From 29 June 2020, patients who were in hospital for elective procedures were only included if they received a positive COVID-19 test result on arrival at the hospital.  

Recovering patients was a category introduced on 26 May 2020 to capture patients who were COVID-19 positive in hospital and who showed no symptoms for 14 or more days but remained in hospital on a COVID-19 treatment pathway, often for rehabilitation. There have been some differences in reporting by health boards in the time series.
