### Cases by Middle Super Output Area (MSOA)

Weekly rolling sums and population-based rates of new cases by specimen date time series data are available to download for English MSOAs via the dynamic selections on the download data page. The data are updated each day, and show the latest 7 days for which near-complete data &mdash; release date minus 5 days &mdash; are available, and historic non-overlapping 7-day blocks. Dates are the final day in the relevant 7-day block, and counts between 0 and 2 are blank in the CSV or NULL in the other formats.
