Data are not reported by each nation every day and Scotland's data are only published weekly.  The definitions are not consistent between the four nations (see below).

#### England

England data include people admitted to hospital who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to admission, and those who tested positive in hospital after admission. Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 after admission are reported as being admitted on the day prior to their diagnosis. Admissions to all NHS acute hospitals and mental health and learning disability trusts, as well as independent service providers commissioned by the NHS are included. Data are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement. The data collected is classified as management information. It has been collected on a
daily basis with a tight turn round time. No revisions have been made to the dataset, where known errors have come to light trusts have made the appropriate correction in the following dayâ€™s data. Any analysis of the data should be undertaken with this in mind. 

Full NHS definitions can be found in the estimated admissions section of the Publication Definitions document available on the [NHS COVID-19 Hospital Activity website](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-hospital-activity/).  Reporting dates reflect admissions and new in-patient diagnoses for the previous day.  On 21st August a 1 day lag behind NHS reporting was corrected. 

Daily data at NHS Trust level is reported weekly on Thursdays, in line with NHS England reporting.

#### Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland data include confirmed COVID-19 admissions by admission date.

#### Scotland

Data for Scotland include admissions into hospital for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission, or during their stay in hospital. The data are published weekly by [Public Health Scotland](
https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/population-health/covid-19/covid-19-statistical-report/).

#### Wales

Wales data include confirmed and suspected cases, and are the numbers of admissions to the hospital in the previous 24 hour period up to 9am. 

It was announced on 13 March that all non-urgent activity should stop to prepare for the pandemic. When elective procedures were re-introduced from June 2020, patients admitted for elective procedures suspected of having COVID-19 were initially captured in COVID-19 related admissions, even if they received a negative test later. This inflated the numbers of suspected cases amongst those admitted to hospital at the time of reporting.  

From 29 June 2020, patients admitted for elective procedures were only included in COVID-19 related admissions if they received a positive COVID-19 test result on arrival at the hospital. Health boards were also asked to exclude transfers between acute and community hospitals from admissions figures. Prior to this, some transfers may have been captured as new admissions.

From 3 July 2020, guidance was updated to only include emergency admissions in the COVID-19 related admissions figures.

The numbers of admissions are not comparable with other nations.
