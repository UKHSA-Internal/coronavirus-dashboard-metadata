Data are not reported by each nation every day and Scotland's data are only published weekly.  The definitions are not consistent between the four nations (see below).

#### England

England data include people admitted to hospital who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to admission, and those who tested positive in hospital after admission. Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 after admission are reported as being admitted on the day prior to their diagnosis. Admissions to all NHS acute hospitals and mental health and learning disability trusts, as well as independent service providers commissioned by the NHS are included. Data are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement.  Full NHS definition can be found in the estimated admissions section of the Publication Definitions document available on the [NHS COVID-19 Hospital Activity website](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-hospital-activity/).  Reporting dates reflect admissions and new in-patient diagnoses for the previous day.  On 21st August a 1 day lag behind NHS reporting was corrected. Data at NHS Trust level is reported weekly, on Thursdays.

#### Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland data include confirmed COVID-19 admissions by admission date.

#### Scotland

Data for Scotland include admissions into hospital for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission, or during their stay in hospital. The data are published weekly by [Public Health Scotland](
https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/population-health/covid-19/covid-19-statistical-report/).

#### Wales

Wales data include confirmed and suspected cases, and are the numbers of admissions to the hospital in the previous 24 hour period up to 9am.  The numbers of admissions
are not comparable with other nations.
