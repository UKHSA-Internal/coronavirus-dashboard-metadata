## About the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK dashboard

The dashboard is an up-to-date and authoritative summary of key information about the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes levels of infections, the impact on health in the UK and on measures taken to respond.  We update it every Wednesday at 4pm to present a dynamic contemporary picture. 

The dashboard meets a strong public need for timely updates at national and local level to ensure good understanding of the progress of the pandemic. We show how the pandemic is changing through: 
- interactive maps
- trends over time of key measures relating to testing capacity and activity, newly-confirmed cases, hospital admissions and deaths

The dashboard supports developers and analysts to reuse data through access to the results in machine-readable files and via an API.

To ensure high public value and quality, the statistics are presented in line with the Code of Practice for Statistics. We provide information on the strengths and weaknesses of the data to help users to interpret them correctly. 

## About the data

All data are updated weekly on Wednesdays at 4pm.

For cases by specimen date and for deaths by date of death, every Wednesday we update the daily numbers of new and cumulative cases and deaths for all previous days for which data are available.

For cases and deaths by report date, we report the number of new cases or deaths as the total number newly reported since the previous week. Previous week’s figures by report date are not revised as they are a record of what was reported at the time. 

Full definitions for the metrics presented in the dashboard are provided in the [Metrics documentation](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/metrics)

### Data availability by area

Different data is shown for different geographical areas.

#### Cases, testing and deaths data

These are shown for:
- the whole UK up to 19/05/2022 when Northern Ireland stopped reporting these data
- nations (England, Northern Ireland (up to 19/05/2022), Scotland and Wales)
- English regions
- local authorities in England, Northern Ireland (up to 19/05/2022), Scotland and Wales

#### Vaccinations data

These are shown for:
- the whole UK
- nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales)
- English regions
- local authorities in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales

#### Healthcare data

These are shown for:
- the whole UK
- nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales)
- English NHS regions
- English NHS trusts

The availability of data for different areas varies between metrics. Some metrics are not available for the whole UK because we do not have data from all nations, and so will only be shown when the area they are available for (for example, England) is selected. Healthcare data for the UK are updated to the latest date that we have data for all nations. More recent data may be available if an individual nation is selected. 

Cases by specimen date and vaccination uptake data are also available for middle layer super output areas (MSOA) in England. These areas are smaller than local authorities, so show data at the most local level. These data are shown on the interactive maps and when using the postcode search.

We are no longer publishing data at lower super output area (LSOA) level following guidance from the Office for National Statistics published by the Department for Health and Social Care: [Office for National Statistics recommendation for publishing data at small geographies for NHS Test and Trace](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/office-for-national-statistics-recommendation-for-publishing-data-at-small-geographies-for-nhs-test-and-trace)

## Other Government Statistics on COVID-19 

### COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring in England tool (CHIME) 

[The national CHIME tool](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/covid-19-health-inequalities-monitoring-in-england-tool-chime) from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities brings together data to monitor the direct impacts of COVID-19 on health inequalities. This includes data on mortality rates, hospital admissions, confirmed cases and vaccinations. 

The CHIME tool presents inequality breakdowns, including by: 

- age 
- sex 
- ethnic group 
- level of deprivation 
- geographical area 

The CHIME tool: 

- shows how inequalities have changed through the pandemic and what the current cumulative picture is 
- brings together data so that users can access and use the intelligence more easily 
- provides indicators with a consistent methodology across different data sets to help understanding 
- supports users to identify and address inequalities within their areas and identify priority areas for recovery 

### Coronavirus (COVID-19) latest insights

A live roundup of the latest data and trends about the pandemic from the Office for National Statistics and other sources.

[The COVID-19 latest insights tool](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights) brings together the latest information from government sources including:

- the COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) –contains high-level estimates on infection for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
- the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey – aims to understand the impact of the pandemic on people, households and communities in Great Britain
- deaths registered weekly – provides provisional counts of deaths registered in England and Wales, including deaths involving COVID-19, in the latest weeks for which data are available. These figures lag behind the daily figures published on the dashboard by at least 11 days.

### Wider Impacts of COVID-19 on Health monitoring tool (WICH)

[The national WICH monitoring tool](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/wider-impacts-of-covid-19-on-health-monitoring-tool) from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities brings together metrics to assess the wider impacts of COVID-19 on health. 

It collates metrics across a range of wider impacts to provide a single point of access. This will help people to:

- monitor changes over time or against an agreed point in time
- make timely, informed decisions
- intervene early to mitigate against poor outcomes
- understand the wider context on population health
