# About the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK dashboard

The dashboard is an up-to-date and authoritative summary of key information about the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes levels of infections, the impact on health in the UK and on measures taken to respond.  We update it daily to present a dynamic contemporary picture. 

The dashboard meets a strong public need for timely updates at national and local level to ensure good understanding of the day-to-day progress of the pandemic. We show how the pandemic is changing through: 
- interactive maps
- trends over time of key measures relating to testing capacity and activity, newly-confirmed cases, hospital admissions and deaths

The dashboard supports developers and analysts to reuse of data through access to the results in machine-readable files and via an API.

To ensure high public value and quality, the statistics are presented in line with the Code of Practice for Statistics. We provide information on the strengths and weaknesses of the data to help users to interpret them correctly. 

# About the data

Full definitions for the metrics presented in the dashboard are provided in the [Metrics documentation](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/metrics)

## Data availability by area

Different data is shown for different geographical areas.

### Cases, testing, deaths and vaccinations data

These are shown for:
- the whole UK
- nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales)
- English regions
- local authorities in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales

### Healthcare data

These are shown for:
- the whole UK
- nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales)
- English NHS regions
- English NHS trusts

The availability of data for different areas varies between metrics. Some metrics are not available for the whole UK because we do not have data from all nations, and so will only be shown when the area they are available for (for example, England) is selected. Healthcare data for the UK are updated to the latest date that we have data for all nations. More recent data may be available if an individual nation is selected. 

Cases by specimen date and vaccination uptake data are also available for middle layer super output areas (MSOA) in England. These areas are smaller than local authorities, so show data at the most local level. These data are shown on the interactive maps and when using the postcode search.

We are no longer publishing data at lower super output area (LSOA) level following guidance from the Office for National Statistics published by the Department for Health and Social Care: [Office for National Statistics recommendation for publishing data at small geographies for NHS Test and Trace](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/office-for-national-statistics-recommendation-for-publishing-data-at-small-geographies-for-nhs-test-and-trace)
