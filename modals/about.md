# About the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK dashboard

The dashboard presents progress of the coronavirus pandemic as an up to date and authoritative summary of key information. This includes levels of infections, the impact on health in the UK and on measures taken to respond.  It presents a dynamic contemporary picture and is updated daily. 

It meets a strongly expressed need from the public for timely updates at national and local level to ensure good understanding of the day to day progress of the pandemic. This is achieved through interactive maps and trends over time of key measures relating to testing capacity and activity, newly confirmed cases, hospital admissions and deaths.

The dashboard provides a tool for developers and analysts by supporting reuse of data through access to the results in machine readable files and via an API.
To ensure high public value and quality, the statistics are presented in line with the Code of Practice for Statistics. Information is provided on the strengths and weaknesses of the data to help users to interpret them correctly.

We are no longer publishing data at LSOA level following guidance from the Office for National Statistics published by the Department for Health and Social Care: [Office for National Statistics recommendation for publishing data at small geographies for NHS Test and Trace](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/office-for-national-statistics-recommendation-for-publishing-data-at-small-geographies-for-nhs-test-and-trace)

### Legacy CSV downloads

The CSV downloads provided from the previous version of the dashboard are available on the download data page. The legacy deaths download is no longer available as the data series has been discontinued.

These files will be updated alongside the main website on a daily basis for the foreseeable future.
However, users are strongly recommended to use the API instead, which give access to the full range of
data in the live site. See the [Developer's guide](https://coronavirus-staging.data.gov.uk/developers-guide)
for details.
