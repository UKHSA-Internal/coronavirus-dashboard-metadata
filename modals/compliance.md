## Statement of voluntary application of the Code of Practice for Statistics

The government’s coronavirus dashboard publishes daily statistics about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the UK.

These statistics are not classed as official statistics because:

* the need to make the data public at speed affects the quality of the data. This is outlined in the section on quality on this page
* this is a new, high-profile dashboard with policy implications affecting the country’s coronavirus response so decisions about content and timing will be influenced by ministers, in particular the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. Ministers’ commitment to the dashboard, and their engagement in its development, have been crucial to the delivery of the project

It is also not possible to meet some other requirements of official statistics. For example, we cannot:

* pre-announce the release time of data (usually 4pm daily) via the release calendar
* restrict early access to the data to a small number of people, although access to the daily update in its final form is limited to the dashboard team

We have therefore voluntarily applied the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/) as follows:

### Trustworthiness

The coronavirus dashboard is produced by Public Health England (PHE), an executive agency
of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). From September 2021, it will be produced
by the UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA), the successor organisation to PHE.

These statistics contribute to the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. In the
interests of openness and transparency, we want to make this data available to everyone.

The statistics have been developed by a team of analysts and data scientists based at PHE,
in collaboration with devolved administrations, NHS England, NHS Test and Trace and the DHSC,
under the guidance of the Head of Profession for Statistics. The dashboard has a steering group
including members from these organisations and from the Office for National Statistics.

The steering group feed into discussions about which statistics we include on the dashboard.
The majority of decisions about the content are made in discussion with the Head of Profession
for Statistics, but on some occasions the final sign-off rests with ministers.

Data are updated daily. We know timely information is important to our users, so we commit to
update the data at 4pm each day. On the rare occasions when delays are unavoidable, we announce
this on our homepage and explain the reasons.

We announce any unexpected changes to the data we release on the homepage and add an explanation
to our [What’s new](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/whats-new) or
[About the data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data) pages. For example:

* delays to data being released
* changes to past data, for example, because positive tests have been reported in error and later need to be removed
* changes to the way data are calculated, for example, to improve the accuracy of data collection

We try to limit these changes, but sometimes they are necessary.

We measure user trust in the dashboard and it has grown over time. Our latest survey (of 37,730 users
in February 2021) found that 90.3% said they trusted the dashboard data.

### Quality

Data are compiled from several appropriate sources:

* Public Health England
* Department of Health and Social Care
* NHS England
* Department of Health of Northern Ireland
* Scottish Government
* Public Health Scotland
* Public Health Wales
* NHS Test and Trace
* commercial partners, for tests carried out in Lighthouse laboratories and public, private and academic sector laboratories
* Office for National Statistics
* National Records of Scotland
* Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency
* House of Commons Library

We maintain close contact with these organisations to make sure that our work is
aligned. Representatives from a number of these organisations sit on the
dashboard steering group.

The COVID-19 dashboard team has 5 sub-teams, who are responsible for maintaining
quality in different areas of work:

* software development team – makes sure the visualisation of data is displayed correctly and on time, provides technical support, and ensures compliance with regulations for data protection and accessibility. The team also looks after the code, the repositories, the ETL service, the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), service infrastructure, database, analytics, logs, resilience, consistency, performance, and security.
* data pipeline team – receives COVID-19 data from various different sources and transforms the different datasets into calculations that feed into the dashboard
* data analysis team – leads the development of the metrics, data and metadata that are fed into the data pipeline; updates the data, quality assures it and draws up reports for relevant stakeholders
* user research and design team – consults users of the dashboard to identify their needs and translates these into content and design improvements and additions
* senior management team – makes sure the dashboard product meets the requirements of users and stakeholders; manages the programmes of work of the other teams

Under the leadership of the Head of Profession for Statistics, our team of professional data scientists and
analysts ensures the dashboard uses correct and appropriate data, processing methods, quality assurance and
visualisations. Statistics, data and metadata are compiled using recognised standards, classifications and
definitions. These are set out in the [About the Data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data) page.

The speed at which the data are produced is unprecedented for health data. This means that, while the data
are appropriate for rapid monitoring of changes in the pandemic enabling swift action to be taken, the data
may not always meet all the quality standards you would expect from finalised official statistics published
a long time after the event. The data are subject to daily revision in some cases and so it would not be
appropriate to badge the dashboard as official statistics.

### Value

The dashboard was created in response to strong public interest in COVID-19 data. It receives around 750,000
users a day, and at its peak has had over one million daily users.

We make sure the information remains relevant by inviting feedback from our users and conducting regular
research with them. We have carried out over 100 individual user research sessions. We have a monitored
feedback email address, which receives hundreds of emails a week, and conduct regular surveys and interviews.
In response to the changing context and changing public interest, we have introduced, for example:

* vaccinations data
* different ways to access local data, including interactive maps and a postcode search

As surveys of existing users will have biases, we are also exploring other ways to get feedback, including
conducting research with people who have not used the dashboard, and with people from ethnic minorities,
who are under-represented among current dashboard users. We have written about a previous survey of the
dashboard in the [Public Health Matters blog](https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/20/covid-19-dashboard-a-design-and-feature-evolution/).

We test statistics with our users to make sure they are not confusing or misleading and make improvements
as necessary. As the public are the main users of the dashboard, we test all visualisations with them to
make sure that the messages they present are clear and understandable.

We try to make the statistics as useful and accessible as possible. Our last survey found that 96% of
users found the information in the dashboard useful and 89% found it easy to understand.

We present data in several ways, to suit different users and help aid understanding. This means the
data is of value both to people looking at it for personal interest, and to those using it for professional
reasons. We provide:

* visualisations, including graphs, maps (choropleths), and arrows to indicate trends
* simple headline figures in web and PDF formats
* full data tables
* data downloads in 4 different formats (CSV, JSON, JSONL, and XML)
* multiple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
* supplementary downloads - e.g. population denominators

We have conducted an accessibility audit of the site and provide an [accessibility statement](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/accessibility). We
are always trying to improve the accessibility of our data.

The dashboard was shortlisted for a Royal Statistical Society Statistical Excellence Award in July 2021.
