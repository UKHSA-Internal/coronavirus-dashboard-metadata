## Introduction

This accessibility statement applies to [coronavirus.data.gov.uk](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk).

This website is run by UK Health Security Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Reporting accessibility problems with this website

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact UK Health Security Agency at coronavirus-tracker@phe.gov.uk.

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

UK Health Security Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

#### Contrast and use of colour

Some content lacks contrast with the background, for example:

* the download button on most pages
* graph colours
* zoom and image download buttons on the graphs

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast).
We are working on a new colourmap which will be implemented soon. It should address the issue with contrast of graph colours. The buttons are part of third party software, so unfortunately we cannot fix these issues.


#### Keyboard navigation

If you are navigating with keyboard only, you cannot tab to some parts of the content. This affects graph-viewing tools that appear on hover, such as the zoom and image download buttons.

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard).

The graphs are created using third party software, so unfortunately we cannot fix this issue.

#### Screen reader accessibility

If you are using a screen reader, such as Jaws or NVDA, some parts of the website are announced unexpectedly. Using Jaws, all the content in the graphs is announced. Using NVDA, there is an unexpected repetition of the word ‘clickable’.

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).

To address screen reader accessibility, we are working to create a static HTML page with improved performance for screen-readers. The page will have a less hierarchical structure and so will be easier to navigate. We will make this page available without minimal styling to accommodate users who may be sensitive to colourful or flashing content. We are also working to create an Easy-Read document as a download.
