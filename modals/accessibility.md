## Introduction

This accessibility statement applies to [coronavirus.data.gov.uk](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk).

This website is run by UK Health Security Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

**Simple summaries**

Simple summaries of some of the information are available to view online or download as a PDF. You can read:

* [a UK summary](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read) – also available from the homepage
* reports on cases, deaths, vaccinations, healthcare and testing for a specific postcode – find these by using the postcode search and clicking on the links under the ‘Additional relevant data’ subheading

**How accessible this website is**

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

* the interactive maps. As these are visual elements, some parts are not fully accessible. All data contained in the maps are also available in other formats, including as downloads
* the graphs. As the graphs are created using third-party software, we cannot fix some accessibility issues. All data contained in the graphs are available to download in alternative formats including CSV, JSON and XML. 

**Device and browser compatibility**

This website works on all devices. It is compatible with the latest versions of all modern browsers. Internet Explorer is not supported.
The interactive map may not work on older devices or devices with smaller memories.

**Reporting accessibility problems with this website**

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact UK Health Security Agency at coronavirus-tracker@phe.gov.uk.

**Enforcement procedure**

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

UK Health Security Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

**Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations**

**Contrast and use of colour**

Some content lacks contrast with the background, for example the zoom and image download buttons on the graphs.

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast). The buttons are part of third-party software, so unfortunately we cannot fix these issues.

**Keyboard navigation**

If you are navigating with keyboard only, you cannot tab to some parts of the content. This affects graph-viewing tools that appear on hover, such as the zoom and image download buttons.

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard).

The graphs are created using third party software, so unfortunately we cannot fix this issue.

**Screen reader accessibility**

Text announces unexpectedly

If you are using a screen reader, such as Jaws or NVDA, some parts of the website are announced unexpectedly. Using Jaws, all the content in the graphs is announced. Using NVDA, there is an unexpected repetition of the word ‘clickable’.

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).

Alternative text

Some alternative text for images does not provide enough information for screen readers. For example:

* in the postcode search results and map pages, the image comparing cases in an area to the UK average is not properly explained
* on the vaccinations page, the chart showing latest reported vaccination uptake is not accessible. There is an alternative accessible version of this image on the homepage and the data are also available in table form.

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content.

Link text

Some link text does not provide enough detail. For example, there are links to documents that are just described as ‘download’ and some pages have several links with the same text.

This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)

We are working to improve these problems.

Alternative formats

The homepage and postcode search pages are static HTML pages. These pages have a less hierarchical structure, making them easier to navigate. 

Some information is also available to download as a [simple summary document](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/easy_read).
