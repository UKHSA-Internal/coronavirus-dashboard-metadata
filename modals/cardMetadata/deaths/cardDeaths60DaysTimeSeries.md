### Daily and cumulative deaths within 60 days of positive test

Total number of deaths of people who had had a positive test result for COVID-19 and either died within 60 days of the first positive test or had COVID-19 mentioned on their death certificate.  This metric is available for England only and presented with deaths assigned to the date when they occurred or the date when they were first reported.

This metric was previously reported on the GOV.UK link below and is included in the dashboard for comparison to the headline 28-day metric.  

Full details of the methodology are available on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary).
