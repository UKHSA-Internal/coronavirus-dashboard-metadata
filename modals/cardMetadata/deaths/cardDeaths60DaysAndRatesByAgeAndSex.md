### Cumulative total number of deaths within 60 days of positive test, by age and sex 

Total number of deaths since the start of the pandemic of people who had had a positive test result for COVID-19 and either died within 60 days of the first positive test or have COVID-19 mentioned on their death certificate, and equivalent death rates per 100,000 resident population. Some records have missing age or sex, so the sum of the subgroups does not equal the total deaths for the area.

This metric is included in the dashboard for comparison to the headline 28-day metric.
