### Cumulative number of people tested by age and sex 

Total number of people with at least one positive or negative COVID-19 virus test result since the start of the pandemic, by age and sex, and equivalent rates per 100,000 resident population. Some test results have missing age or sex, so the sum of the subgroups does not equal the total people tested for the area.
