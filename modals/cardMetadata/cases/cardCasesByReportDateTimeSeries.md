### Daily and cumulative numbers of cases by date reported

Number of people with at least one positive COVID-19 virus test result. Initially only pillar 1 tests (NHS and, in England, UKHSA labs) were included but pillar 2 (commercial tests) have been included from varying dates between 15th June and 14th July for each nation, leading to step increases in the numbers of cases for the individual nations reported at different times. On 2 July, case data from pillars 1 and 2 of the testing programme were combined and de-duplicated, resulting in a step decrease in the cumulative number of cases reported at UK level.
