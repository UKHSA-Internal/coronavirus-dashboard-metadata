### Daily and cumulative numbers of cases by test type

Number of people with at least one positive COVID-19 test result by type of test used in their first positive test, and specimen date. 

There are several different types of COVID-19 test. These include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, lateral flow device (LFD) tests and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) tests. These tests differ in their sensitivity (the proportion of positives that are correctly identified) and specificity (the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified). 

In certain situations, and times of low prevalence, a confirmation PCR test is recommended to those with a positive LFD result. Certain uses are always recommended to get a confirmation PCR, regardless of prevalence. These are self-reporting LFDs and cross-channel hauliers.

Test types are shown as PCR (including LAMP and LamPORE tests), LFD confirmed (positive PCR result has been returned with a specimen date within 2 days of the positive LFD test) and LFD unconfirmed (positive PCR result has not been returned with a specimen date within 2 days of the positive LFD test).
