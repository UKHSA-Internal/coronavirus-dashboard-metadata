### Daily and cumulative numbers of cases by test type

Number of people with at least one positive COVID-19 test result. Cases are shown by type of test used in their first positive test and by specimen date. 

There are several different types of COVID-19 test. These include:
* polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests
* rapid lateral flow (LFD) tests 
* loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) tests

These tests differ in their sensitivity (the proportion of positives they correctly identify) and specificity (the proportion of negatives they correctly identify). 

In certain situations and times of low prevalence, a confirmation PCR test is recommended to people with a positive rapid lateral flow test result. Self-reporting rapid lateral flow tests and cross-channel hauliers are always recommended to get a confirmation PCR, regardless of prevalence.

Test types are shown as:
* PCR (including LAMP and LamPORE tests)
* LFD with positive PCR (positive PCR result has been returned with a specimen date within 3 days of the positive rapid lateral flow test) 
* LFD without positive PCR (positive PCR result has not been returned with a specimen date within 3 days of the positive rapid lateral flow test)
