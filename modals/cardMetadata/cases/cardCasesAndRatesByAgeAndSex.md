### Cumulative total number of cases, by age and sex 

Total number of people with a lab-confirmed positive COVID-19 PCR test result reported since the start of the pandemic, and rates of cases per 100,000 resident population. Some test results have missing age or sex, so the sum of the subgroups does not equal the total cases for the area.
